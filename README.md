I'm currently Writer and Cohost of the [Latent Space](https://latent.space/) AI newsletter/podcast and [working on something smol](https://smol.ai/). I previously helped lead or build DevRel/DX at AWS and 3 devtools unicorns (Netlify, Temporal, Airbyte). Because I love GitHub and this is my GH Readme, I guess I should also say that I'm honored to be a [GitHub Star ‚≠ê](https://stars.github.com/) as it has changed my life and I often share freely about how [I use GitHub for all sorts of unusual things](https://www.google.com/search?q=swyx+how+i+use+github).

I previously did a lot of community work for the React, Svelte, DevTools Angel Investing, and general JavaScript community, but now those have become less of a focus as my new founder duties ramped up.

If you are a junior developer looking to level up to senior, I <a href="https://learninpublic.org/?from=GH%20README">wrote my book for you</a>.
